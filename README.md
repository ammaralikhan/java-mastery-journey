# Java Mastery Journey

From absolute novice to production-ready Java engineer — a living curriculum focused on deep understanding, cloud-native fluency, and operational excellence.

## Philosophy

- **No black boxes**: Every line of code, every tool, every concept is explained at the level of _why it exists_.
- **Build like you ship**: Code is written as if it will run in a GDPR-compliant, monitored, multicloud environment — because it will.
- **Progress, not perfection**: This is a _living repository_. Expect evolving structure, iterative improvements, and real-time learning.
- **Own the stack**: You write it, test it, containerize it, deploy it, and observe it. Full-cycle ownership from day one.

## Learning in Context

This journey runs alongside my participation in **[Nooremarendaja – kood/Jõhvi](https://nooremarendaja.kood.tech)**, Estonia’s intensive developer training initiative. While that program provides broad full-stack foundations, this repository dives deeper into **JVM internals**, **secure system design**, and **cloud-native engineering practices**—skills essential for infrastructure-aware application development in modern teams.

## Structure

This repo evolves with my learning. Current phases reflect deliberate progression:

- `phase1/` — How computers execute code: variables, types, JVM basics
- `phase2/` — Java syntax, control flow, methods, and program structure
- `phase3/` — Object-oriented design, memory, debugging, and encapsulation
- `phase4/` — Collections, file I/O, generics, and concurrency fundamentals
- `phase5/` — Testing, build automation (Gradle), logging, and Git hygiene
- `phase6/` — REST APIs, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and security patterns
- `phase7/` — Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, observability, and GCP deployment

> Branches track active work (`phase3-oo-design`, `phase6-notes-api`).  
> `main` always reflects stable, reviewed progress.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Exercises explained**: Not just “code that works”—but code with reasoning, alternatives, and trade-offs.
- **CLI-first tools**: Wordle-like games, notes managers, cipher utilities—built to teach I/O, state, and UX.
- **DevOps integration**: Trivy scans, non-root containers, Helm charts, and secrets management from day one.
- **Zero AI tone**: Every word written by hand, for engineers who value clarity over fluff.

## Commit & Contribution Standards

- Commits follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`)
- No secrets, no binaries, no IDE metadata (enforced via `.gitignore`)
- All code is written on an 8 GB MacBook Pro using VSCode and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (via Multipass)
